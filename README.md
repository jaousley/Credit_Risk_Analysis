# CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS

## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS 

The purpose of the analysis evaluate different machine learning models to determine which models should be used to predict credit risk. The models include RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, and EasyEnsembleClassifier. 

## RESULTS
